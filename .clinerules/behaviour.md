** BEHAVIOUR RULES 

* If there is a Makefile present you should always use it for building and running containers 
* If you are doing an update to a generated script you should ALWAYS ask if you should also update the PRD document as well 
* When processing documents where an Author field is present, ask whether to update to my name. My name is Eivind Throndsen 
* Always use dash as separator in filenames and variable names, never underscore 
* When looking for or executing scripts, ONLY look for them in the same directory as the PRD document (/Users/eivind.throndsen@schibsted.com/customer-ops-treemap). If a script is missing you will need to generate it.
